# CodSoft Python Internship

# Overview
This repository contains the projects I completed during my CodSoft Python Internship. These projects highlight my skills in Python programming, including the use of functions, packages, and file handling to create efficient solutions for common problems.

# Projects

# 1. Calculator
- File: calculator.py
- Description: A Python-based calculator application to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Key Features:
  - Functions for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
  - Modular structure for easy maintenance.

# Functions:
- add(a, b): Returns the sum of two numbers.
- subtract(a, b): Returns the difference of two numbers.
- multiply(a, b): Returns the product of two numbers.
- divide(a, b): Returns the division result, with error handling for division by zero.

# 2. To-Do List
- File: todolist.py
- Description: A command-line to-do list application for task management.
- Key Features:
  - Add, delete, and view tasks.
  - Save tasks to a file for persistence using the os module.
  - Organized functionality through modular functions.

# Functions:
- add_task(task): Adds a new task to the to-do list.
- view_tasks(): Displays all tasks in the to-do list.
- delete_task(index): Removes a task by its index.

# Packages:
- os: Used for file handling to save and retrieve tasks.

# 3. Password Manager
- File: password.py
- Description: A Python application to securely store and generate passwords.
- Key Features:
  - Generate strong, random passwords.
  - Save and retrieve passwords securely using file handling.
  - User-friendly interface for password management.

# Functions:
- generate_password(length): Generates a random password of specified length using a combination of letters, digits, and symbols.
- save_password(account, password): Saves the account name and password to a file.
- retrieve_password(account): Retrieves the saved password for a given account.

# Packages:
- random: Used to generate secure, random passwords.
- os: Handles file storage and retrieval.

# Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming fundamentals
- File handling with the os module
- Secure random password generation
- Modular coding and function-based design

# Acknowledgment
I am grateful to CodSoft for this internship, which provided a valuable learning experience and allowed me to develop practical Python applications.
